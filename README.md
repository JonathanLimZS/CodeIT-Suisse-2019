These instruction are to help you solve a test challenge "Calculate Square". Instruction to this test challenge can be found at https://calculate-square.herokuapp.com/instructions

Step by step

As per the instruction you have to implement a post endpoint /square

- Go to `square.py` under `codeitsuisse/routes` folder in this template and you will find a post method with name  `/square` 
- write your implementation in this method. This method will be the entry point when you submit your solution for evaluation
- Note the __init__.py file in each folder. This file makes python treat directories containing it to be loaded in a module
- Follow similar approach to implement actual challenges during the event
