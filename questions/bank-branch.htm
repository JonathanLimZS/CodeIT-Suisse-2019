            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                While most banks are striving to divert their customers away from branches to consume their digital banking services, many customers today still choose to visit the bank branch.
                <br><br>
                On a normal day, customers are patiently waiting in line at the bank branch, each waiting to be served by a branch officer. There are branch officers who can be determined from a collection of whole numbers given to you. [2, 3, 10, 4] would give you B = 4 branch officers working that day, and each branch officer can be uniquely identified by their id, which is the index + 1 of each element in that collection. Branch officers have their own X amount of serving time and their serving time can be determined by the element in the collection.
                <br><br>
                For example, the first branch officer has X = 2, the second branch officer has X = 3, the third branch officer has X = 10 and the fourth branch officer has X = 4. Each branch officer can only serve 1 customer at a time. When the bank first opens and/or when there are multiple available branch officers, the customer at the head of the queue will proceed to the lowest numbered branch officer. Once a branch officer finishes serving a customer, he immediately serves the next customer in line. When no branch officers are available, the customer next in line will have to wait until the next branch officer is available.
                <br><br>
                You are the Nth customer in the queue, determine the id of the branch officer that will serve you.
