<h1 id="ready-player-one">Ready Player One</h1>
<hr>
<p>There are 2 Jars.
Jar 1 is filled with N number of balls labelled with numbers from 1,2,3...N and
Jar 2 is empty.</p>
<p>T is the target the player needs to achieve.</p>
<p>Two players take turns playing this game of choosing balls from Jar 1 to put into Jar 2.
The player who puts a ball from Jar1 to Jar2 when the sum of the numbers on all balls in Jar 2
equals or crosses the target (T) will win the game.</p>
<p>The aim of this problem is to return if it is possible for Player1 to win the game assuming both players play their best.
If yes, then return maximum number of moves it can take for player 1 to force a win, else -1.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-example-playthrough">The Game Example Playthrough</h2>
<p>Value of N (maxChoosableInteger) =5 and value of T (desiredTotal) =10
Which means 1,2,3,4,5 balls are available in Jar 1 and target for both the players is to reach or cross the target 10.</p>
<p>Player1 will always start the game followed by Player2.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say :- <br/>
Player1 selected ball number 5 from Jar 1 and put it in Jar 2. <br/>
Player2 selected ball number 1 from Jar 1 and put it in Jar 2. <br/>
Player1 selected ball number 4 from Jar 1 and put it in Jar 2. <br/></p>
<p>Now the total number in Jar2 reached 10 and the last person who picked the ball from Jar 1 to Jar 2 was Player1 so in this case Player1 won the game.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expose a POST method with endpoint <code>/readyplayerone</code></li>
<li>Return minimum number of moves or -1 as json</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>  N&lt;=20, T&lt;=200</p>
<h2 id="input-description">Input description</h2>
<p>The HTTP POST request will come with a body of Content-Type: application/json</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: N=10,T=15<br/>
<strong>Output</strong>: 3 <br/>
<strong>Explanation</strong>: If player1 chooses 4, then no matter what player2 chooses player1 
will win in the next move. Thus player1 can force a win in 3 moves. eg. 4,1,10 ;
4,2,9; 4,3,8 ...</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: N=6,T=12 <br/>
<strong>Output</strong>: 3 <br/>
<strong>Explanation</strong>: If player1 chooses 6, then no matter what player2 chooses player1 
will win in the next move. Thus player1 can force a win in 3 moves. eg. 6,1,5 ;
6,2,4; 6,3,4 ...</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: N=5,T=11 <br/>
<strong>Output</strong>: -1 <br/>
<strong>Explanation</strong>: No matter what player1 chooses in the first move, player2 can force
a win. eg. 5,1,2,3 ; 4,2,1,5 ; 3,2,1,5 ; 2,3,1,5; 2,3,5,4; 1,4,2,5 ...</p>
