    <p>A reverse lottery is a lottery where a set of 10 winning numbers will be predetermined at the start of every hour. The aim of each team will be to guess the set of winning numbers.</p>
    <p>Possible numbers ranges from 1 to 100 inclusive.</p>
    <p>Guesses that are closer to the set of winning numbers will be given a higher score, with the exact guess getting maximum score.</p>
    <p>The numbers can be assumed to be arranged in a circular manner like the numbers on a clock for points calculation. Meaning the numbers next to 100, are 99 and 1. For example, if the answer is [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100] A guess of [1, 1, 1, ... , 1] will give a higher score than a guess of [98, 98, 98, ... , 98].</p>
    <p>Also, the order of the numbers matters. For example, if the answer is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100] A guess of [100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10] will not suffice.</p>
    <p>The biggest source of motivation are your thoughts, so think big and motivate yourself to win.</p>
    <p>When you feel like quitting, think about why you started.</p>
    <p>The Bearer is the key to authentication.</p>
    <p>Nothing is impossible, the word itself says I'm Possible!</p>
    <p>Plan your guesses wisely, and may the odds be ever in your favour.</p>
